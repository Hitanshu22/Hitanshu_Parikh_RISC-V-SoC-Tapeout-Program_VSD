Welcome to my journey through the **SoC Tapeout Program VSD**!  
This repository documents my **week-by-week progress** with tasks inside each week.  

"In this program, we learn to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. Part of India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering participants to build silicon and advance the nation’s semiconductor ecosystem
