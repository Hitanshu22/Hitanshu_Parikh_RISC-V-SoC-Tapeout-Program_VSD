#  RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program VSD
<div align="center">


</div>


This repository documents my **week-by-week progress** with tasks inside each week.  

In this program, we learn to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. Part of India‚Äôs largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering participants to build silicon and advance the nation‚Äôs semiconductor ecosystem.

## üìÖ Week 0 ‚Äî Setup & Tools

| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|---------|
| [**Task 0**](Week0/Task0/README.md) | üõ†Ô∏è [Tools Installation](Week0/Task0/README.md) ‚Äî Installed **Yosys**, **Iverilog**, and **gtkWave** | ‚úÖ Done |



### Key Learnings from Week 0
- Installed and verified **open-source EDA tools** successfully.  
- Learned about **basic environment setup** for RTL design and synthesis.  
- Prepared the system for upcoming **RTL ‚Üí GDSII flow task**.

## üìÖ Week 2 ‚Äî Fundamentals of SoC Design

| Task       | Description | Status |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------ |
| [**Task 1**](Week2/README.md#-fundamentals-of-system-on-chip-soc-design) |  Write-up on SoC fundamentals | ‚úÖ Done |
| [**Task 2**](Week2/README.md#-vsdbabysoc--a-tiny-but-powerful-risc-v-soc) |  VSDBabySoC  | ‚úÖ Done |
| [**Task 3**](Week2/README.md#-pre_synth_sim-waveform) | Pre synthesis Waveform  & explanations | ‚úÖ Done |

###  Key Learnings from Week 2  

* Gained conceptual understanding of **SoC fundamentals** (CPU, memory, interconnect, peripherals).  
* Learned how **BabySoC** simplifies SoC design concepts and verified its behavior using simulation + GTKWave.
* [Future Work:](Week2/README.md#-future-work) Add memory for instruction fetch and enable C programs to be compiled into hex for execution on BabySoC.
