## 1. Introduction  

The goal of Week 2 is to strengthen our **grasp of SoC design fundamentals** and perform **hands-on functional simulation** with the BabySoC model.  

Main learning outcomes include:  

- Break down the architecture of a System-on-Chip (SoC)  
- Study interaction between CPU, memory, and peripheral blocks  
- Use **Icarus Verilog** for simulation and **GTKWave** for waveform analysis  
- Record insights from signal behavior and timing diagrams  

The work is organized into **two major sections**: theory + lab exercises.

## 2. Part-1: Theory & Concepts  

**Aim:** Develop conceptual clarity on SoC design with BabySoC.  

**Topics Covered:**  
- SoC definition and relevance in modern electronics  
- Common SoC blocks: CPU core, memory, buses, peripherals, clock/reset circuitry  
- Why BabySoC is used as a learning-friendly abstraction  
- Importance of functional modelling before moving into RTL and physical design  
- Conceptual notes & diagrams  

**Outcome:** A markdown document with summarized theory, illustrations, and explanations.

## 3. Part-2: Practical Simulation  

**Aim:** Run BabySoC simulations and analyze functional behavior.  

**Workflow:**  

- Compile BabySoC Verilog sources with **Icarus Verilog**  
- Generate `.vcd` files for waveform inspection  
- Verify reset sequence, clock operation, and signal transactions between CPU, memory, and peripherals  
- Capture GTKWave screenshots with annotated observations  
- Collect console logs and results for documentation  

**Outputs:**  

- Log files from simulation  
- Waveform screenshots + analysis notes  
- README with detailed observations
